Hi Iornfly Technologies
the belowing is my submission link (github)

First of all, sorry for the bad coding skills, be honest my last time to use Angular can be throwed back to 2019, its been too old, i have try myself to learn Angular 17
and how does the Angular 17 work, for the option 1 may be a reletively "easier" task for me because i don't know web worker at all( i have do some research and trying to figure out how Angular 17 work and how to implement web worker into it)
Which i have try my best to catch up from the internet for the nesseccery knowledge for Angular framework, the project is something very basic and simple, thank you for your time to read.
